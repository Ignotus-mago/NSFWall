Software for generating a mural design for the lobby of the new National Science Foundation elevator lobby. The design is based on the Fibonacci series used a custom version of my FiboTree software. This image (https://www.flickr.com/photos/ignotus/6762348043/in/album-72157627693651317/) supplies some of the color and design ideas. This software was developed in the Eclpse IDE using the Processing 2.2.1 core.jar library. It requires my IgnoCodeLib library and the ControlP5 library. which can be downloaded via https://processing.org/reference/libraries/. The ControlP5 library's external windows will not work with Processing 3. The code can be easily modified to run directly in Processing 2.2.1: see the note on how to do this, ProcessingEclipse.txt.

# Our own stuff to ignore #
###########################
# we won't include libraries such as our local copy of core.jar
# we'll skip Eclipse's files that refer to the local setup and system
# and also ignore the bin directory with compiled code and settings
/libs
/.settings
/.project
/.classpath
/bin

# Compiled source #
###################
*.com
*.class
*.dll
*.exe
*.o
*.so

# Packages #
############
# it's better to unpack these files and commit the raw source
# git has its own built in compression methods
*.7z
*.dmg
*.gz
*.iso
*.jar
*.rar
*.tar
*.zip

# Logs and databases #

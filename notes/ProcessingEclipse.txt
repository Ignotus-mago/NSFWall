A Processing PApplet in Eclipse

In Eclipse, you can run Processing code but it requires some adjustments. 


import processing.core.PApplet;


public class PlanarSymmetry extends PApplet {

	public void setup() {
		
	}
	
	public void draw() {
		
	}
	
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		PApplet.main(new String[] { "--present", "PlanarSymmetry" });
	}

}


To go back the other way, from Eclipse to Processing:

Paste the source into BBEdit. TextWrangler, or your favorite editor. Specify that it is 
Java source (popup at bottom of BBEdit or TextWrangler window).

Delete last curly bracket.
Delete line with class header and bracket ("public class Tracker03 extends PApplet {").
Delete "import processing.core.*;".
Delete "main" method.
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		PApplet.main(new String[] { "--present", "Tracker00" });
	}
Select all text.
Shift it left (with Text menu or "command=[");
With text still selected, choose "Detab..." from the text menu. Replace tabs with 2 spaces (standard in Processing).
Copy and paste into a Processing window. 

There may be a few other edits, depending on your code, but this is the basic pattern to follow.
